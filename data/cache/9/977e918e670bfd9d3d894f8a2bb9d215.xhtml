If you&#039;d like to change the logo, simply use the Media Manager to upload a <code>logo.png</code> into the <code>wiki</code> or the root namespace and it will automatically be used. You can also upload a <code>favicon.ico</code> there. If you use a closed wiki it is recommended to make the <code>wiki</code> (or root) namespace world readable in the <abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr> settings or your favicon will not be shown to logged-out users.

To add a navigation to the sidebar, you can add a page called <code>topnav</code> and add a list of links to it. (No other content is supported.)
